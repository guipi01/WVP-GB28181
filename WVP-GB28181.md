# 可复现问题的步骤 The steps to reproduce.
The latest version of wvp GB28181 pro is 2.0. Let's first take a look at the effect of a normal page loading platform:

When ordinary users delete their own accounts, for example:

总的来说就是 如果有用户被删除，只要他不注销账号，就一直可以访问平台的任何资源，导致信息泄漏，希望作者大大后面可以修复这个问题
In general, if a user is deleted, as long as they do not log out of their account, they can always access any resources on the platform, leading to information leakage. I hope the author can fix this problem in the future
